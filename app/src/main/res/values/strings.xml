[TAB]Generates basic chess endgames and let you play them again computer (at its best level).[CR][CR][CR]


[TAB]First, you have to select a chess endgame kind in the menu screen : when the endgame is in a green line you have to win, and
        when the endgame is on a orange line you have to draw.[CR]
        [TAB]Then you will get into the playing screen,
with a random position based on the endgame you chose. The color you have is also determined randomly.
You are given your goal : knowing you always start the game.[CR][CR][CR]



[TAB]You move a piece with the Drag And Drop interaction. There are also lines "around your finger",
in order to indicate more
the cell where you are going to leave the piece : which can be very useful if you are on a small device.[CR]
[TAB]Whenever the game is finished, you have the possibility to review moves (either by touching a move,
or by using the history arrow buttons).[CR][CR]

[TAB]You also have three buttons, actives whatever the game state, which let you respectively
reverse the board, restart the last generated position or generate a new position for the same kind
of endgame.[CR][CR]


[TAB]You can find the project files at https://goo.gl/KDKig0.[CR][CR]
